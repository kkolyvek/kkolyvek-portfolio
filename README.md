</h2>

This repository contains the source code for Koppi Kolyvek's online portfolio. The site is built around CSS flex-boxes with the help of [Bootstrap 5.0](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) to allow for a pleasant experience at any browser dimension.

The 'work' section features clickable image links that navigate to the deployed application. The 'contact' section includes a fillable form that takes advantage of the user's default mail program.
